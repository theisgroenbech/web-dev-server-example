# web-dev-server-example
This repository is for a Github-issue in web-dev-server.

It is a clone of the [react-tsx](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/example-projects/tree/master/react-tsx) example with small additions.
- I have added `React-Router` as a dependency
- Used React-Router in `App.tsx`.

If I run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:8000/demo` it fails with
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: import not found: createElement
```
